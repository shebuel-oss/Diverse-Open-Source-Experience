# Diverse-Open-Source-Experience (DOSE)
<h3>Curated stories and experiences of first-time open-source contributors.</h3>
<p>
  My aim is to amplify the voices and contributions of first-time contributors as I possibly can, so that we can all work together to make 
  open source better for every first-timer. These experiences could range from the excitement, joys, pains, challenges, successes, 
  and everything in between. Thereby serving as a source of inspiration to thers.
</p>
  
  <h4>what Impact could this have?</h4>
  
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Creating this platform would help these contributors appreciate every effort they put in to contribute to open source 
        no matter how little. This would in turn, keep them motivated to make more impactful contributions to the community. </li>
      <li>Open source enthusiasts who are yet to make their first contribution, can now have a clearer picture of the nuances of being 
        a first time contributor. </li>
      <li>This would attract and retain more enthusiastic contributors to open source. </li>
      <li>This would contribute to the building of a healthy open source environment. </li>
      <li>Open source organizations and communities would need informations like these to help the improve processes like onboarding and support 
        for first-time contributors. </li>
    </ul>
